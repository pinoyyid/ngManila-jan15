Sample code from Anatomy presentation.

This repo contains a complete push of the local project, including bower_components and node-modules. 

The code implements a super simple (aka hugely incomplete) Todo application. 
The purpose is to provide a better skeleton than the empty scaffolding provided by the typical Yeoman generators. 
In fact this project was kickstarted using the standard Yeoman generator, so the file layouts should be familiar.

## Prerequisites
You will need :-
- [ ] node and npm
- [ ] grunt
- [ ] bower
- [ ] typescript. This is technically optional, in which case you will be editing the .js files and ignoring the .ts files. NB. this is a really bad idea. You are much better served by using the project as a way to get into typescript.
