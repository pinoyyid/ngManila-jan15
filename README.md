# ngManila-jan15
Sample code from Anatomy presentation.

This repo contains a complete push of the local project, including bower_components and node-modules. 

The code implements a super simple (aka hugely incomplete) Todo application. 
The purpose is to provide a better skeleton than the empty scaffolding provided by the typical Yeoman generators. 
In fact this project was kickstarted using the standard Yeoman generator, so the file layouts should be familiar.

## Prerequisites
You will need :-
- [ ] node and npm
- [ ] grunt
- [ ] bower
- [ ] typescript. This is technically optional, in which case you will be editing the .js files and ignoring the .ts files. NB. this is a really bad idea. You are much better served by using the project as a way to get into typescript.

## Installation
 - git clone https://github.com/pinoyyid/ngManila-jan15    # downloads the repo
 - cd ngManila-jan15                                       # cd into the newly created dir
 - unzip deps.zip                                          # unzip the node_modules and bower_compnents
 - mv bower_components app                                 # move bower_components into the correct position
